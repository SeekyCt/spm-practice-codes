## Branches
### main
The main branch contains the source of the latest release of the mod.
### dev
The dev branch contains in-development features and usually isn't ported to or tested on regions other than PAL. Settings files generated in builds from this branch may also not be supported in future versions.

## Building
To compile this yourself, you'll need the following:
* devkitPPC
* ninja
* Python 3
    - 3.8 is known to work, earlier versions may too
* The python modules from `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* The fork of PistonMiner's elf2rel from the [SPM Rel Loader repo](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-rel-loader/releases/)
    * For v8 and above, the 21-12-2021 build is required. v5-7 require the 24-6-2021 build. Older versions are compatible with any build
* The ELF2REL environment variable set to the path to your compiled `elf2rel` executable

Once that's set up:
* Run `configure.py`
    * Versions can be listed as arguments to enable them, by default all will be enabled
* Run `ninja`
    * Versions can be listed as arguments to build them (must be enabled in `configure.py`), by default all will be built

## Credits
* This mod was made using the [SPM Rel Loader](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-rel-loader), which is based on the TTYD rel loader by PistonMiner and Zephiles.
* JohnP55 for help and suggestions creating the map change teleport effect.
* TheLordScruffy for the Dolphin & Riivolution detection methods.
* stebler for `tools/incbin.S`.
